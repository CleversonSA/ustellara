# uStellara SDR Receiver
An rtl_fm console frontend using ncurses to tune RTL SDR Dongles. 
It was built and projected for Raspberry PI 3+ and small 3.5 LCDs Screens,
so, in big screens could get problems.

# To build
I use gcc (GNU C Compiler), but I've not migrated to make and install schema, so I created a ./build.sh file and a ./run.sh one.
